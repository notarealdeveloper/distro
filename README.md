           lib

   * re-usable code
   * language specific
   * reuse with import
   * stands for library
   * the beginning, or src

           ---

           bin

   * re-usable code
   * language agnostic
   * reuse with exec
   * stands for binary
   * the middle

           ---

           app

   * not re-usable
   * lives in opt, which
     stands for "optional"
   * also known as a "product"
   * what most company processes
     implicitly incentivise all
     internal code to be.
   * the end, or dst

what we call best practices

makes software applications

but distro maintainers know

not all code should be apps

           ---

to make code that can scale

never think of it as an app

until youre almost finished

or your time will be wasted

           ---

always eat your own dogfood

&& optimize for reusability

&& study linux from scratch

&& abandon your other rules
